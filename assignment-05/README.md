1) The head and body elements only require one of each as all applicable content is contained within them. The body is what we see and interact with on a given page and the body element contains all this information so it isn't floating around free, the head sets some of the style elements and gives the browser a name for the tab or window itself.
2) Structural mark up is the actual coding itself, it includes things like paragraph breaks, lists, and all other forms of markup that makes the web browser interpret and display. Semantic markup is the way we give emphasis to words on the web page to convey meaning to the end user.
3) My work cycle was pretty simple, I went through the lesson and then started the assignment. Evidently I hadn't totally digested everything because I had to go back and reference some of the code again in order to get it all right. I think in the end I found what I needed and implemented it all correctly, and hopefully through repetition I can remember the little tricks as well as I remember the more common types of markup.
