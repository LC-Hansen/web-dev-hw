System fonts are local to each computer and are the ones currently installed in the systems memory. Web fonts are designed for browsers of any shape and size, and have a larger variety than the web safe fonts which are considered safe to use because the fonts will be universally recognized and content will be displayable.

The importance of fall backs in a stack is so that you can guarantee your page will display for everyone. It wouldn't do anyone any good to spend all that time and money on building a site for it to be inaccessible by a large portion of the populace. Its basically a fail safe.

I don't know what it is but dealing with fonts has been by far the hardest thing I've done in this class so far. It felt like it took me way way longer than it should have for me to get anything at all done, I liked the resources so I chose two complimentary fonts from one of the TODO's and that was a great start. It also took me a little bit of time to find something to use, when I first read the assignment I was going to do a Grimm's fairy tale, but I think using the Dada Manifesto was cool, I've read it a few times and I find it to be a worth wile read every time. Once I figured out the initial struggles it was just a matter of making it look like something I wanted. I should have picked something more whimsical to do more interesting things with the text, but maybe next time.
