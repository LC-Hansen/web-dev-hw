<p>"We started out waiting. In the same place for things dreamed, two roads meet surrounded by green trees, and we... were both... just waiting."<br><br>
The first spoken lines in my 10 minute play "Straight Escape; A Goodbye Lullaby" speak to feelings many young people experience, and to the memories of the rest of us. The play is hard to represent digitally, but if you are willing to explore the text I believe you can experience this work in a meaningful way.<br><br>
This is a work of highly stylized theatre. Unfortunately there are no recordings of it in performance, so I will give you the tools to visualize the work on your own. It is poetic linguistically, abstract and avant guarde in presentation, and tonally reliant on the music which scores the work.<br><br>
The song below plays during the opening half of this roughly 10 minute work. I think it is good to listen to it now, and listen to it again later in the full text tab while you read the stage directions.<br><br>
Enjoy: "S.A.D Light" by Glasvegas.<br><br>
