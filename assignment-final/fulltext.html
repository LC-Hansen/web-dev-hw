  STRAIGHT ESCAPE: A Goodbye Lullaby.
  By L.C. Hansen<br><br>


  <i>Darkness for two beats. “S.A.D Light” begins to play very low, after 5 seconds of the song the lights fade up from directly Left stage approximately eight feet high. It is an extremely dim blue and orange light, as if on a bright snowy night with a full moon and the pervasive orange glow of city street lights. The lights only highlight the edges of the scenery, which consists of a counter directly under the light on stage Left where a bottle is placed, and across at up stage right sits an old man in a chair. He is sunken into the seat of the chair. He is bent in half with his face resting on his right knee. The music has been slowly rising to a medium volume until the 33 second mark, where it holds. The man has been slowly starting to engage his musculature and by 1:19 the man’s head has fallen off his knee and is now inching toward the ground. By 1:30 the man’s face has touched the ground and his arms fall onto the ground slapping the floor audibly. By 1.56 the man has slid onto the floor and his tailbone and butt have collapsed with the rest of his body. He starts to crawl to the left side of the chair, but doesn’t make it far. He drags up his body about 4 feet away from the chair and maintains his balance while bent over. From 1.56 the music has been swelling and is now at a slightly higher than medium volume where it holds until 3:05 where it has swelled to full volume. The man unfolds by 2:45 and starts to walk towards the light. He has taken ahold of the bottle by 3:30 where the lights begin to fade to black for the next 24 seconds, as the man brings the bottle to his mouth. After the song ends a beat passes and the bottle drops to the ground.)

  MALE:
  We started out waiting<br><br>

  <i>Lights up on a table with two chairs across from each other, the man is sitting stage right and the woman is sitting stage Left, there is a bottle in the middle of the table and two full shot glasses sitting on the table for each of them. During each monologue the actor not speaking remains completely oblivious to the other character, no matter how intense their scene partner gets, they at times become distracted by arbitrary things: a fly buzzing around, a drum beat or the music of a song, the mockery of their partner, simply their breathing, picking a scab) 
  </i><br><br>

  MALE:
  In the same place for things dreamed, two roads meet surrounded by green trees, and we... were both... just waiting. A smile opened a new world where time bent and laughs meant the world, and our hearts raced and blood paced through veins placed, in genitalia. Those days raced and raced past hearts which started slowing. Unforeseen screams started growing.  Cold hearts in cold shoulders speckled like pebbles falling, where darlings changed to far away mourning distance of lovers continued growing. Our carousel kept going round and round while cracks started spreading, from tiny horse’s manes where paints nicked to brass poles split... all the while going. Round and round... and round... and round ‘til the force broke loud our whaling sad sounds. <br><br>

  <i>Beat.
  The two take a shot and slam their glasses down.</i><br><br>
  
  FEMALE:
  I've written on my lids to which my eyes fix, and painted in bright colors dreams of child and mother. A calm peace enveloped in serene scenes in dreams dreamed; that you've missed. So many times you've sped by in a sonic boom boomed fracturing the tiny glass illusory image, which, I'll keep looking back on in sad, long, years. This hope for which you grope, or mourn for in the dryness, this specter through which your light shines distorted. Has broken Me. Its grip sticks, to my mind, my insides, so tattered like spatters I'm battered! Defeated and beaten.<br><br>

  <i>The man starts laughing as he pours two more shots.</i><br><br>

  From bar stools your face drooled over twats and ass' smacked spreading your god knows what from girls fucked and ill pills swallowed all brought back home- to me. The person unseen. The woman in need.  <br><br>

  <i>Beat, they take their shot.</i><br><br>   

  MALE:
  Conflicts greater than scene scripts; glossed with boozy blues and glazed eyes, tonight.  We linger for hours without repose and she goes Down the alley way of pain. Sardonically stomping bang bang she rocks me. Prancing and tap dancing gliding gaily, baiting. Like stitches ripping from thin skin; big blisters popped to murk out pussy pain drops. You tossed em, so simply shot out, so simply so easy. You've lost me.  I'll proceed to recede; shell off the gross loss, now that the child like daydreams have been made mean in so nonchalant a fashion. With smiles and winks you spread your stink springing into action when weakness is lovers fashion.<br><br>

  <i>Woman Laughs and pours shot.</i><br><br>

  My nights were spent in company non judging after too many nights spent recouping from verbal whiplashing’s, argumentative bashings and laughing through it all was you. <br><br>

  <i>Beat, they take shot.  </i><br><br>

  FEMALE:
  We've no longer got a home it's melted so, so slow. Our fabrics un-weaved like a smoke show through which the wind’s blown. Unforgotten but lost in a solemn haze our memories now fade, and the crystal smudges and muddies. Now laid, is the final days where we've faked prays, lost our brains and danced in cold rains.<br><br>

  <i>Man has extended laugh which is uncomfortable and extremely animated, he pours shots as if he was serving tea to the Queen.</i><br><br>

  The bitter bite on our bodies un-helped by our swearing apologies, has left us weak. Too malnourished in love to cling any longer to old heart tugs. And now, it's our love- that's died.  <br><br>

  <i>Man holds shot glass in air as woman does not take her shot, he laughs and continues normally.   </i><br><br>

  MALE:
  After streaks of dried tears fade, memories hold tight inside her face. That's where I'll always play, giddily prancing in her brains. Constant pulling, wryly goading, over growing; I'll ruin her like she ruined me.  Tonight is so special, like I've seen. In flickering screen scenes, pain so carefully crafted tears so expertly provoked. Many last legs walked on.  Dreams crumble and fade long gone.<br><br>

 <i>Looks 40 degrees to right of woman.</i><br><br>

  <strong>That can't be all?</strong><br><br>

  <i>Lights out.
  End of Play.</i>
