<p>This work was heavily inspired by the works of Samuel Beckett, Antonin Artaud, and Sarah Kane. Their works are at times highly stylized and unnatural, and in the case of Artaud's "Theatre of Cruelty" purposefully untraditional in relation to Western Theatre.<br><br>
Below is a for film version of Samuel Beckett's work "Play" and gives greater context to the form of style I am talking about in the stage directions for "Straight Escape".<br><br>

There is no artist more influental than Sarah Kane on this particular work. Her work is harder to distill given that she only created 6 works during her career before her suicide. There is only one with a difinitive version on film for me to share, and this work is perhaps the least like what I have written. I will share this with a strong warning that it contains extreme scenes of Nazi imagery, violence, murder, nudity, sex, and sadism. The work however was created for television for BBC and is without a doubt unquestionably artistically important for what it is.<br><br>

She chose very stylistic stage directions and exacting pace instructions in her works. To her, much like Beckett, the form of a work IS its content, and that is the key aspec which my work shares with hers. The intentional mix of all aspects from content, to timing are key elements in my view of works for theatre, and the artists here have all played a profound role in helping me formulate my understanding, philosophy, and artistic vision in "Straight Escape"</p>
