The Web connects information via hypertext, and the internet physically connects the people who can access information.
The internet takes input and breaks it into packets of information which are then sent via light waves along lines of cables to be compiled and reconstructed in a server.
A directory is a hierarchical organization of subdirectories which organize the web site logically, files are the data contained on each web page which are navigable though the directory pathways.
VCS is benefical because it allows us to work collaberatively, create versions of the document to log changes, revert back to previous versions, prepare for professional work, and have access to free hosting. This was interesting to learn about because the company Blizzard Entertainment just reverted back to a previous version of their World of Warcraft game to produce a "classic" version, I heard about this incedentally today and they used a similar process which we will have access to.
