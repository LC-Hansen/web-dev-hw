  </p>As you can see, bold patterning, and high contrast in color was becoming all the rage. Compare the wallpaper from <a href="https://hannahstreasures.com/products/1960s-floral-vintage-wallpaper-mn227"> Hannahs Treasures</a> I used as the background and this poster from <a href="https://visualartsdepartment.wordpress.com/psychedelic-60s/">Visual Arts Department</a> by: Wes Wilson on the right.

    <p>This final picture from <a href="https://www.vintag.es/2017/07/1960s-interior-decor-decade-of.html">Vintag</a> demonstrates many of the characteristics I found. It has strong elements of Rococco in its whimsy and fantastical version of nature, as well as Danish Mid-century Moderns mentality of simplicity and sophistication. It plays on many of these themes to develop its own sense of kitch.</p>
