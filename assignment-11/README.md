Padding is what designates the edge of the element or box from the outer edge of the text within that box, borders are the edge of element stylings to separate one from the other. Margins define how the total element is separated from the other elements and allows us to place the divisions in space how we want.

This was pretty straight forward for me, I just went through everything and then started my assignment and looked back on on the materials as I needed reminders. I completely forgot to actually make a sketch though, so that was kind of a big error in work flow in my opinion.
